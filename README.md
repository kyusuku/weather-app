# Weather App

Weather App is a browser-based web application created as part of my journey through The Odin Project curriculum. This is my twelfth project, and it focuses on building a dynamic and interactive weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for real-time weather information, toggle between temperature units, and enjoy a visually appealing interface with animated backgrounds.

## How to Use

- 🔍 **Search Location:** Enter a location in the search bar and click the search button or press "Enter" to fetch weather data.
- 🌡️ **Toggle Units:** Use the toggle switch to change the temperature unit between Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C).

## Try It Out

👉 You can view and interact with the Weather App here: [My Weather](https://kyusuku.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides a simple, intuitive layout for easy navigation.
- 🌦️ **Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetches current weather conditions using the Visual Crossing Weather API.
- 🌡️ **Unit Toggle:** Allows users to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature display.
- 🌟 **Dynamic Background:** Includes animated stars and shooting stars for a visually appealing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Used for creating the structure of the weather application.
- **CSS3:** Provides styling and animations for a visually pleasant interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the dynamic content updates and DOM manipulation.
- **Webpack:** Used to bundle JavaScript modules for efficient loading and management.
- **Visual Crossing Weather API:** Provides real-time weather data.

## Project Structure

### Files and Directories

- 📄 `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the weather application.
- 🎨 `styles.css`: The stylesheet that defines the layout, design, and animations of the page.
- 📜 `index.js`: The main JavaScript file that implements the dynamic content updates and API integration.
- 📁 `icons/`: Directory containing SVG icons used for weather conditions.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built with the following objectives:

- 🏗 **HTML and CSS Layout:** Building the structure and styling of a weather application.
- 🎨 **JavaScript Functionality:** Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior, such as fetching and displaying weather data.
- 📊 **DOM Manipulation:** Using JavaScript to dynamically update the page content based on user interaction.
- 📦 **Webpack Integration:** Using Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules for efficient loading and management.
- 🌐 **API Integration:** Fetching real-time weather data from an external API.

## Future Improvements

- 📱 **Mobile Optimization:** Making the page responsive for better usability on smaller screens.
- 🌍 **Geolocation Support:** Automatically detect the user's location for weather data.
- 📅 **Forecast Feature:** Add a 7-day weather forecast.
- 🎨 **Enhanced Styles:** Adding custom styles or animations for a better user experience.
